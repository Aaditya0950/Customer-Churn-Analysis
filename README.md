# Customer Churn Analysis & Classification

A Python-based project for analyzing customer churn, using exploratory data analysis and machine learning to predict which customers are likely to churn. Employs libraries like Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib for data preprocessing, visualization, model training, and evaluation.

## Motivation

Customer churn (customers leaving a service) is a critical challenge in many industries (telecommunications, subscription-services, etc.). Being able to predict which customers are likely to churn allows businesses to take proactive steps (offers, improved service, personalized communication) to retain them, saving costs and improving customer lifetime value. This project demonstrates how to perform churn analysis from raw data to predictive modeling.

## Project Structure

Here is an overview of the main files in the repository:

| Filename | Description |
|---|---|
| `WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv` | The main dataset with customer usage, contract, payment information, etc. |
| `tel_churn.csv` / `first_telc.csv` | Possibly preprocessed or alternate versions of the dataset. |
| `Churn Analysis - EDA.ipynb` | Jupyter Notebook for exploratory data analysis (visualizing, cleaning, feature exploration). |
| `Churn Analysis - Model Building.ipynb` | Notebook for model building: training, comparing multiple algorithms, evaluating performance. |
| `Customer Churn Knowledge.py` | Python script (or module) for possibly reusable functions, model inference, utilities. |
| `model.sav` | Serialized trained machine learning model (e.g. via `pickle` or `joblib`). |
| `churm analysis.pbix` | Power BI file for interactive dashboards / visualizations. |
| `LICENSE` | Licensing information (MIT License). |

## Data

- Data Source: Telco Customer Churn dataset.  
- Key features in data: customer demographic info, contract type, payment method, usage metrics, etc.  
- Target variable: whether a customer has churned (Yes / No).
